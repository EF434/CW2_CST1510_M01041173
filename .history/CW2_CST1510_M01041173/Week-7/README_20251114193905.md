## Project Description
This project is a command-line authentication system designed to securely handle user registration and login using password hashing. Users can register new accounts with strong passwords, log in with existing credentials, and experience additional security features such as role-based access, account lockout, and session management.

## Features
- Secure password hashing using bcrypt with automatic salt generation
- User registration with duplicate username prevention
- User login with password verification
- Input validation for usernames and passwords
- File-based user data persistence

## Technical Implementation

- **Hashing Algorithm:** bcrypt with automatic salting
- **Data Storage:** Plain text files (`users.txt`, `sessions.txt`) with comma-separated values
- **Password Security:** One-way hashing; no plaintext storage
- **Validation:**
  - Username: 4–20 characters, alphanumeric with optional underscores (not at start/end), cannot be all numeric, no spaces
  - Password: 6–50 characters, must include uppercase, lowercase, digit, optional special character, cannot contain username
- **Account Lockout:** 3 failed login attempts → 5-minute lock
- **Session Management:** Generates secure random 32-character hex token stored in `sessions.txt`
