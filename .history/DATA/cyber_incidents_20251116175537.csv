Stuxnet was the first publicly known instance in which a cyber operation caused physical damage outside of a controlled testing environment. It demonstrated the potential effectiveness and value of a cyber weapon. Many experts and former government officials feared that the attack on Natanz would open the door to other states conducting destructive cyberattacks and Stuxnet would represent, in the words of former Director of the National Security Agency Michael Hayden, a moment when “somebody crossed the Rubicon.” However, nation-states have so far exercised restraint.",Sabotage,High,Investigating

The threat actors breached 1,295 computers in 103 countries over a two-year period, predominately focusing on governments in Southeast Asia. The GhostNet operation was discovered after an investigation into a potential breach of the office of the Dalai Lama in India. Investigators at the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab confirmed that the threat actors were based in China.

The report about GhostNet was one of the first publicly available in which computer security researchers outlined their methodology and backed up their claims with forensic evidence [PDF], demystifying cyber operations and demonstrating that private actors had significant capabilities to attribute threat actors.",Espionage,Critical,Investigating

11/28/2008,Associated with Turla,"Agent.btz was malicious software designed to steal documents from classified and unclassified U.S. military networks in 2008. A flash drive infected with Agent.btz was reportedly inserted into a laptop at a U.S. military base in the Middle East, and from there the worm spread undetected to U.S. computers at the Department of Defense and in combat zones. Russia is suspected of being behind the incident. Once the compromise was detected, it took fourteen months to remove Agent.btz from the Pentagon’s networks and the incident triggered a departmental ban of USB drives.

Agent.btz was a significant breach of U.S. military systems, and the vulnerabilities it exposed ultimately led to the creation of U.S. Cyber Command, a military command with the mission of defending Department of Defense networks and conducting offensive cyber operations for the U.S. military.",Espionage,HIgh,Resolved

For three weeks, threat actors targeted state and commercial websites, ranging from foreign and defense ministries to banks and media outlets, by overloading their bandwidth and flooding their servers with junk traffic, rendering them inaccessible to the public. In order to mitigate the onslaught, Estonia briefly closed its digital borders and blocked all international web traffic.
