Course: CST1510 — Multi-Domain Intelligence Platform

Project Description

This project transitions your Week 7 file-based user management system into a professional SQLite database system. You will implement a full data pipeline that loads CSV data into the database, supports CRUD operations, and ensures secure and efficient data management. The database now handles users, cyber incidents, datasets metadata, and IT tickets, forming a robust backend for multi-domain intelligence operations.

Features

Database Migration: Converts users.txt into a SQLite users table

Database Schema: Four tables — users, cyber_incidents, datasets_metadata, it_tickets

CRUD Operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete records via Python functions

CSV Integration: Load domain-specific CSV files efficiently using pandas

Secure Queries: Parameterized SQL queries prevent SQL injection attacks

Authentication: Register and login users securely using bcrypt

Analytical Queries: Aggregate and summarize data (incident counts, severity levels, etc.)

Comprehensive Testing: Functions validated through automated test routines

Technical Implementation

Database Engine: SQLite (lightweight, file-based relational database)

Python Modules:

sqlite3 → Connect and interact with the database

pandas → Efficient CSV reading and database insertion

bcrypt → Password hashing for secure authentication

Database Structure:

users → Authentication and role management

cyber_incidents → Security incident tracking

datasets_metadata → Metadata for datasets

it_tickets → IT support tickets

Security:

Passwords hashed with bcrypt, never stored in plain text

All SQL queries use parameterized statements

Data Loading: CSV files inserted using pandas.DataFrame.to_sql()

CRUD Example:

Create: Insert new incident

Read: Retrieve incidents as pandas DataFrame

Update: Modify incident status

Delete: Remove incident by ID

Learning Objectives

Understand the benefits of using databases over plain text files

Connect and interact with SQLite from Python

Define and create relational database tables using SQL

Implement secure CRUD operations for multiple domains

Load and query large datasets efficiently

Perform analytical queries to extract actionable insights
