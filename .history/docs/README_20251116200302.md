**Building Your Database Layer**

<hr style="border:2px solid #0EA5E9">

### What You'll Build This Week

This week, you're transitioning from **file-based storage** (`users.txt`) to a **professional database system** (SQLite). By the end of this lab, you will have:

1.  **Migrated** your Week 7 users from `users.txt` → SQLite database
2.  **Created** database tables for all three domains (cyber_incidents, datasets_metadata, it_tickets)
3.  **Loaded** CSV data using pandas
4.  **Implemented** CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using Python functions
5.  **Secured** your queries against SQL injection attacks
6.  **Tested** your database with real-world queries

### Learning Objectives

By completing this lab, you will:

- Understand **why databases are better** than text files for data storage
- Learn how to **connect to SQLite** using Python's built-in `sqlite3` module
- Write **SQL CREATE TABLE** statements to define your data structure
- Implement **CRUD operations** using Python functions
- Use **parameterized queries** to prevent SQL injection
- Load **CSV files** efficiently using pandas
- Query your database to extract **meaningful insights**

### Beginner Tip

Think of a database like a **super-powered Excel file** that:
- Lives on disk (persists data)
- Lets you search, add, update, and delete data **without reading the whole file**
- Can link related data together (users → incidents)
- Protects against data corruption
