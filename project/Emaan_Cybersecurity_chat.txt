ASSISTANT:
Phishing is a type of cyberattack where attackers attempt to deceive individuals into providing sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, and credit card numbers, by masquerading as a trustworthy entity. Phishing is categorized under the MITRE ATT&CK framework's tactic of **"Initial Access"**.

### Key Features of Phishing

1. **Vector**: 
   - Primarily delivered through email, but can also occur via SMS (smishing), social media, phone calls (vishing), and other communication platforms.
   
2. **Techniques**:
   - **Deceptive Phishing**: Crafted messages that mimic legitimate services (e.g., a bank or popular website).
   - **Spear Phishing**: Targeted attacks on specific individuals or organizations, often using personal details to increase credibility.
   - **Whaling**: Targeting senior executives within an organization.
   - **Clone Phishing**: Duplication of legitimate messages with malicious links or attachments.
   - **Pharming**: Redirecting users from legitimate websites to fraudulent ones.

3. **Indicators**:
   - Suspicious email addresses or domain names.
   - Urgent call-to-action messages designed to create panic or a sense of urgency.
   - Poor language quality or slight modifications of legitimate brand logos or names.

### Attack Vectors and Methods
- **Email Attachments**: Malicious files disguised as legitimate documents.
- **Hyperlinks**: Links leading to fraudulent websites crafted to harvest credentials.
- **Web Forms**: Forms that collect sensitive information presented under legitimate masquerading.

### Mitigations
- **Technical Controls**:
  - Implement email filtering solutions to detect and block phishing attempts.
  - Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to prevent unauthorized access using compromised credentials.
  - Employ Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance (DMARC) to prevent domain spoofing.

- **User Awareness and Training**:
  - Conduct regular security awareness training sessions focusing on identifying phishing attempts.
  - Simulate phishing attacks to test user awareness and responsiveness.
  
- **Incident Response**:
  - Establish a clear process for users to report suspected phishing attempts.
  - Regularly update and patch software to protect against vulnerabilities that may be exploited during phishing campaigns.

By understanding phishing techniques and implementing these mitigations, individuals and organizations can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to phishing attacks.
